# Pixel Quest: The RPG

This is a simple fighting game where you choose a fighter and attempt to bring all of the other fighters' HP down to 0. They all have different stats, so be careful who you pick!

## Features

* Each fighter object is created from a basic constructor function
* Each figher has access to the attackUp method to boost their power every turn
* Each fighter's pixel art is my own original design using the free software GIMP

## What I'd like to expand

* Add in a defense, speed, and magic stat
* Give each fighter the ability to heal
* Give each fighter a unique set of abilities/differing movesets

## Future Goals
* Create a leveling system such that a player can return in his browser and continue playing at his current level
* More pixel art, more things to fight :)
